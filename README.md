This repository hosts a collection of small, focused projects aimed at exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic frameworks. It serves as a flexible sandbox for testing ideas, prototyping tools, and learning about various techniques in LLM orchestration, autonomous agents, and AI-driven workflows.
The experiments may include, but are not limited to:

Building simple agent architectures

Integrating with popular agentic frameworks (Python or TypeScript)

Exploring prompt engineering, memory, planning, and tool use

Comparing approaches across different ecosystems

The goal is rapid iteration, hands-on learning, and knowledge sharing around the evolving landscape of LLM-based agents.
