# writing-enhancement-team

## Overview

**writing-enhancement-team** is a modular LLM-based agent system designed to automatically assess and enhance the quality of written content. It provides an automated pipeline that evaluates user-provided texts, generates targeted improvement suggestions, and applies those improvements to deliver a refined version of the original content.

This project is useful for any application requiring high-quality text production, including content writing, documentation review, AI-generated text validation, and more.

**Role**: Applies the suggestions provided by `text_reviewer` agent to improve the original text.

- **Responsibilities**:
